# Greedy
CS50 Pset1

Program asks the user how much change is owed and then spits out the minimum number of coins with which said change can be made. Use GetFloat from the CS50 Library to get the user’s input and printf from the Standard I/O library to output your answer. Assume that the only coins available are quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢).
